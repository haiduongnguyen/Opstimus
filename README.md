[My Personal Page](https://haiduongnguyen.github.io/)

## Overview
This project, **Opstimus**, focuses on anomaly detection using multi-channel data. It was developed as part of my Master Thesis to explore advanced techniques in detecting anomalies across multiple data streams.

## Features
- Multi-channel data processing
- Advanced anomaly detection algorithms
- Scalable and modular design

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Opstimus.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Opstimus
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your multi-channel dataset.
2. Run the anomaly detection script:
    ```bash
    python detect_anomalies.py --data your_dataset.csv
    ```
